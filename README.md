# Automatic duplication video on another language

This is a project, which can help you to dublicate video on any language.

# Problematics

There are many different languages ​​in the world and all people speak different languages, which is a problem when distributing content to foreign countries or when communicating with foreigners. This project is able to solve this problem by dubbing videos into foreign languages ​​with cloning the original voice of the speaker

# Relevance

There are not many models in the world that are capable of dubbing videos into different languages ​​with voice cloning, especially free ones. Many of them are blocked on the territory of the Russian Federation. Our project is a Russian analogue, which is absolutely free to use and has open source, which makes it possible to use it anywhere

# Target

- Automate video translation into different languages.

# Tasks

- Make an algorithm to translate language into video
- Wrap it up in a user-friendly interface
